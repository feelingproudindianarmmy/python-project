#practise for bit section

#first taking some constant var
num1=10
num2=6
num3=4

#printing the numbers in binary using diffrent means or types
print(bin(num1))
print(bin(num2))
print(bin(num3))
print(num1&num3)
print(num1|num3)
print(~num2)
print(num2^num3)

#.:this was some examples aout the binary digits
